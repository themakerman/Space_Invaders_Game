2 Copy all the .dll files in bin folder to your computers windows directory inside system32(if x86 bit) else sysWOW64(if 64 bit system).


3 Next copy the remaning two folders i.e include and lib folder to the directory where Visual Studio 2010 is installed inside VC folder.



4 Last step is to configure visual studio. We have to tell VS that we are using Allegro library to avoid the linker error.Right click on your project_name in solutions explorer  --> properties --> Linker --> input --> additional_dependencies --> type --> allegro-5.0.1-monolith-md-debug.lib
